# deepxiv-sdk

**DeepXiv is an agent-first paper search and progressive reading tool.**

Install it with `pip`, start using it immediately, and let the CLI auto-register a token on first use. No extra setup is required before your first query.

## What DeepXiv Does

DeepXiv is built around two core workflows that matter for agents:

1. **Search + Progressive Content Access**
2. **Trending + Popularity signals**

Instead of blindly loading full papers, DeepXiv lets agents read in layers, based on token budget and task value.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install deepxiv-sdk
```

On first use, deepxiv automatically registers a free anonymous token (1,000 requests/day) and saves it to `~/.env`:

```bash
deepxiv search "agentic memory" --limit 5
```

If you want the full stack including MCP and the built-in research agent:

```bash
pip install "deepxiv-sdk[all]"
```

## CLI-First Workflow

The CLI is the primary interface. DeepXiv is designed so agents can work like researchers: search first, judge quickly, then read only the most valuable parts.

```bash
deepxiv search "agentic memory" --limit 5
deepxiv paper 2603.21489 --brief
deepxiv paper 2603.21489 --head
deepxiv paper 2603.21489 --section Analysis
```

Three commands matter most for progressive reading:

- `--brief`: decide whether a paper is worth deeper reading
- `--head`: inspect structure, sections, and token distribution
- `--section`: read only the most valuable parts such as `Introduction`, `Method`, or `Experiments`

This is the core DeepXiv idea: agents should not load full papers unless they truly need them.

## CLI Features

### 1. Paper Search and Reading

```bash
deepxiv search "transformer" --limit 10
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --brief
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --head
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --section Introduction
deepxiv paper 2409.05591
```

### 2. Trending and Popularity

Research is not only about what exists, but what is worth reading now.

```bash
deepxiv trending --days 7 --limit 30
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --popularity
```

- `trending` finds the hottest recent papers from social signals
- `--popularity` gives paper-level propagation metrics such as views, tweets, likes, and replies

### 3. Web Search

```bash
deepxiv wsearch "karpathy"
deepxiv wsearch "karpathy" --json
```

Notes:
- `deepxiv wsearch` calls the DeepXiv web search endpoint
- each `wsearch` request costs **20 limit**
- an auto-registered anonymous token gets **1,000 limit per day** (~50 web searches/day)
- a token registered at [data.rag.ac.cn/register](https://data.rag.ac.cn/register) gets **10,000 limit per day** (~500 web searches/day)

### 4. Semantic Scholar Metadata by ID

```bash
deepxiv sc 258001
deepxiv sc 258001 --json
```

`deepxiv sc` fetches metadata using a Semantic Scholar paper ID.

Notes:
- this is useful when your workflow already has Semantic Scholar IDs
- DeepXiv will **soon provide a Semantic Scholar search service** that returns Semantic Scholar IDs directly

### 5. Biomedical Papers

```bash
deepxiv pmc PMC544940 --head
deepxiv pmc PMC544940
```

## Example Agent Workflows

### Workflow 1: Review recent hot papers

```bash
deepxiv trending --days 7 --limit 30 --json
```

Then an agent can:

1. run `--brief` for each paper
2. run `--head` for the most promising ones
3. read only key sections
4. produce a report without manually opening dozens of papers

This workflow has already been written as a reusable skill. See [skills/deepxiv-trending-digest/SKILL.md](skills/deepxiv-trending-digest/SKILL.md).

### Workflow 2: Enter a new research topic

```bash
deepxiv search "agentic memory" --date-from 2026-03-01 --limit 100 --format json
```

Then an agent can:

1. batch-brief the results
2. prioritize papers with GitHub links
3. inspect experiments via `--head`
4. read `Experiments` / `Results`
5. turn datasets, metrics, and scores into a baseline table

This workflow is also available as a reusable skill. See [skills/deepxiv-baseline-table/SKILL.md](skills/deepxiv-baseline-table/SKILL.md).

## Built-in Deep Research Agent

If you do not want to compose the workflow manually, the CLI already includes a built-in research agent.

```bash
pip install "deepxiv-sdk[all]"
deepxiv agent config
deepxiv agent query "What are the latest papers about agent memory?" --verbose
```

If you already have your own agent stack, you can also just plug in the DeepXiv CLI skill and keep your own orchestration.

## Agent Integration

DeepXiv is designed to work well inside Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, and similar agent runtimes.

## Python Usage

```python
from deepxiv_sdk import Reader

reader = Reader()

results = reader.search("agent memory", size=5)
brief = reader.brief("2409.05591")
head = reader.head("2409.05591")
intro = reader.section("2409.05591", "Introduction")

web = reader.websearch("karpathy")
sc_meta = reader.semantic_scholar("258001")
```

## Roadmap

DeepXiv is moving toward an **academic paper data interface at 100M+ scale**.

The roadmap is:

1. **Full arXiv coverage with T+1 automatic updates**
2. **anyXiv coverage**, including bioRxiv, medRxiv, and similar repositories
3. **Full open-access literature coverage**

The metadata backbone will increasingly rely on **Semantic Scholar metadata as the base layer**, while continuously expanding coverage and enrichment quality.

## Current Coverage

- ✅ **arXiv** - current primary source
- ✅ **PubMed Central (PMC)** - biomedical and life sciences
- 🔄 **Semantic Scholar metadata integration** - expanding as the metadata foundation

> DeepXiv focuses on open-access literature so agents can work on unrestricted paper data instead of getting blocked by subscription barriers.

agent = Agent(api_key="your_openai_key", model="gpt-4")
answer = agent.query("What are the latest papers about agent memory?")
print(answer)
```

## Token Management

deepxiv supports 4 ways to configure tokens:

**1. Auto-registration (Recommended)** - Automatically creates and saves on first use (1,000 requests/day)
```bash
deepxiv search "agent"
```

**2. Using config command**
```bash
deepxiv config --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

**3. Environment variable**
```bash
export DEEPXIV_TOKEN="your_token"
```

**4. Command-line option**
```bash
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Daily limits by token type**:

| Token type | Daily limit | How to get |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-registered (anonymous) | 1,000 requests | Happens automatically on first CLI use |
| Registered token | 10,000 requests | Sign up at [data.rag.ac.cn/register](https://data.rag.ac.cn/register) |
| Custom / higher limit | Contact us | Email `tommy[at]chien.io` and describe your use case |

### Free Test Papers

These papers can be accessed without a token:

**arXiv**: `2409.05591`, `2504.21776`
**PMC**: `PMC544940`, `PMC514704`

## MCP Tools

Available tools when using MCP Server:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_papers` | Search arXiv papers |
| `get_paper_brief` | Quick summary |
| `get_paper_metadata` | Full metadata |
| `get_paper_section` | Read specific section |
| `get_full_paper` | Complete paper |
| `get_paper_preview` | Paper preview |
| `get_pmc_metadata` | PMC paper metadata |

## Agent Usage (Optional)

The built-in ReAct agent can automatically search papers, read content, and perform multi-turn reasoning:

```python
from deepxiv_sdk import Agent

agent = Agent(
    api_key="your_deepseek_key",
    base_url="https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
    model="deepseek-chat"
)

answer = agent.query("Compare key ideas in transformers and attention mechanisms")
print(answer)
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
deepxiv agent config  # Configure LLM API
deepxiv agent query "What are the latest papers about agent memory?" --verbose
```

## Error Handling

deepxiv provides specific exception types:

```python
from deepxiv_sdk import (
    Reader,
    AuthenticationError,  # 401 - Invalid or expired token
    RateLimitError,       # 429 - Daily limit reached
    NotFoundError,        # 404 - Paper not found
    ServerError,          # 5xx - Server error
    APIError              # Other API errors
)

try:
    paper = reader.brief("2409.05591")
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Please update your token")
except RateLimitError:
    print("Daily limit reached")
except NotFoundError:
    print("Paper not found")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Do I need a token to use?**
A: No. Some papers are free to access. Search and some content require a token, but it's auto-created on first use.

**Q: What's the maximum search results?**
A: 100 per request. Use `offset` parameter for pagination.

**Q: How to handle timeouts?**
A: Reader automatically retries (max 3 times) with exponential backoff. You can customize:
```python
reader = Reader(timeout=120, max_retries=5)
```

**Q: Can I cache paper content?**
A: Yes. After getting content with reader, cache locally to database or file system.

**Q: Which LLMs does the agent support?**
A: Any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, local Ollama, etc.).
